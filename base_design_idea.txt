Core idea
Want to create an bug bot agent using claude agent sdk and fastapi (anyother api framework)
* Which can get webhooks from slack (from bug reports channel)
* Once it got the webhook, reply back that is got the report and will investigate further and inform that it will tag L1 / devs if required
* Then it should call the claude agent sdk, to debug the issue with the details the reporter provided
    * The claude agent, will have skills to solve or debug frequent issues or bugs
    * claude agent should use grafana and newrelic mcp to gather further information regarding the issue
    * Should query github to find the relevant repo and clone it for further use
    * Should be able to query databases to find relevant data
    * Should be able to provide a code or data fix
    * If code fix is needed, create a PR in the relevant repos
    * If it is not a simple fix or you cannot conclude the issue, tag relevant devs (frequently) and l1
* If fix is made or need human help, should create a thread in another channel with debugging details and pr link if any, with the original bug report thread link
* It should peridically ask for updates from devs or l1 if the bug is open without any resolution after a sla

Provide a high level technical document, on how this can be implemented and tech stack, frameworks and packages required
Deployment strategy for claude agent sdk, how it will clone repos and query github etc.
and check whehther temporal can be used for any of the use case.
While creating a plan, if you are facing any doubts ask the user instead of assuming.
